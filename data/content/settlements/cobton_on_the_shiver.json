  "atmosphere": "Upon first impression, all in Cobton seems well. Animals merrily go about their business, fishing, sailing little boats, making and mending, smoking pipes and drinking tea. In truth, however, the inhabitants of the Valley live under the totalitarian rule of the crookhorn Baron Fragglehorn and his band of ruffians.",
