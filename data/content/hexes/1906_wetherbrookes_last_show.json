Five enclosed wagons with doors and windows, eclectically adorned with baroque woodwork. Three cage-wagons with rusty cages, atop wagon bases. Large enough to house great beasts. The cages are unlocked and contain only parched straw. Painted on the sides of the wagons, in large, highly-stylised red-and-yellow letters, are the words 'Wetherbrooke's Wild World of Wonders.' There is no path between the trees by which the wagons might have arrived here.",

Under the bed is a locked wooden strongbox, easily forced open, containing 205sp. Two long orange wagons: Tightly packed bunks line the walls, some containing small animal nests. The far end of each wagon is partitioned into a pair of tiny bedrooms. Short black wagon with purple trim: An embroidered cloth-covered table with a cracked crystal ball and a bed behind a curtain. Stale smell of incense. Upon entering, a disembodied female voice shrieks, urging PCs to flee the encampment immediately. Under the table is a hollow fake thumb holding a carnelian (50gp). Large white wagon: Empty crates; dried-out, brittle leather tent-bundling straps.",
