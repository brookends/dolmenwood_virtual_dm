Gloomy clefts: At various heights from the ground, both sides of the trough feature many clefts deep and wide enough for Small characters to fit inside, though most terminate a short distance into the rock. Befuddling echoes: A traveller taken by a whim to bellow into a cleft is often surprised to hear their voice echoing back at them from some point ahead or behind of them on the path, often rendered comical or sinister by distortions.
